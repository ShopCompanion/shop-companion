As a cross-plattform, Greasemonkey-style userscript, ShopCompanion uses wrappers for its Browser-specific versions. It uses [Scriptify](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/scriptify/) for the Firefox release and [BabelExt](https://github.com/honestbleeps/BabelExt) for the Chrome version.

### Author

This add-on has been released by [evrybase.com](http://www.evrybase.com/). Evrybase's idea is to gather product metadata. As a start, we've released this browser-extension. Building on that, evrybase will eventually grow into a web-application where users are able to curate products they love and exchange and share information about them.
