### Author

This add-on has been released by [evrybase.com](http://www.evrybase.com/). Evrybase's idea is to gather product metadata. As a start, we've released this browser-extension. Building on that, evrybase will eventually grow into a web-application where users are able to curate products they love and exchange and share information about them.
